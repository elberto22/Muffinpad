The Muffinpad is a 9 key Macropad made using a Waveshare RP2040.

To assemble you will need:

  3D printed case (Soon)

  Muffinpad PCB

  9 Mx style switches

  Waveshare RP2040 Zero

I will update the read me as i further progress in building the muffinpad.

I will also consider making different versions that are compatible with more MCU's and More features i.e Oled Display, Rotary Encoder.
