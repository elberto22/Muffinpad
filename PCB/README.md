The Muffinpad is a 9 key Macropad made using a Waveshare RP2040.

To assemble you will need:
3D printed case (Soon)
Muffinpad PCB
9 Mx style switches
Waveshare RP2040 Zero 

I will update the read me as i further progress in building the muffinpad.




I will also consider making different versions that are compatible with more MCU's and More features i.e Oled Display, Rotary Encoder.
